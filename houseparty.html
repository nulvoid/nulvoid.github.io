<p><b>Katherine</b><br />
There is only one path for Katherine, ending in getting laid. You can skip the Cellphone Jammer steps if you use the steps from Rachels guide to get Katherine upstairs into the Study, and the Stephanie and Britney guide to get Britney downstairs. You can finish Katherine&#8217;s story in the same playthrough as Rachel&#8217;s story, so I recommend to do it that way as the Cellphone Jammer can be annoying.</p>
<p>After you do Katherine&#8217;s Story you can complete any other story, it will have no effect on the other girls.</p>

8. Talk to Frank<br />
-Ask what he thinks of Katherine<br />
-Ask if you can take the Empty Vodka Bottle<br />
-Tell him he&#8217;s guarding the booze<br />
9. Talk to Katherine<br />
-Tell her Frank is guarding the booze<br />
10. Talk to Frank<br />
-Tell him you&#8217;ll put in a good word with Katherine if he lets you take some<br />
11. Turn the Cellphone Jammer On and follow Katherine around till she&#8217;s alone.<br />
12. Talk to Katherine<br />
-Tell her the plan<br />
-Tell her to take her top off<br />
-Tell her that&#8217;s not what you meant<br />
13. Take tiddypics of Katherine<br />
(13a.) At this point, entirely optional of course, you can pose her on her knees, flop it out and rub one off all over her face, this will not stop you from getting to the end of her story.<br />
14. Give the Camera to Frank complete with pictures of Katherine covered in your spooge.<br />

16. Give Rum to Katherine<br />

22. Go back to Master Bedroom, close and lock the door<br />
23. Give Katherine the water, get undressed, get laid<br />
24. Find her again later and ask for another round</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stephanie (and Britney)</b><br />
Both included in one section because, for now, all you can really do with Britney is tell her to go downstairs after you complete Stephanie&#8217;s story.</p>
<p>These stories have no current effect on any of the girls with endings in place, do them at will.</p>
<p>1. Get Whipped Cream from Fridge (behind some boxes, use &#8216;the hand&#8217; (ctrl key) to get past them)<br />
2. Get Chardonay from Laundry Closet (top shelf)<br />
3. Talk to Frank<br />
4. Talk to Patrick, Give Painkillers to Patrick, Talk to Patrick again<br />
-Tell him to be careful of Frank<br />
-Ask him how he hides his booze<br />
5. You can ask him this right in front of Frank for instant results, or go tell Frank that Patrick is hiding booze<br />
6. After they start fighting, you can pick up the Merlot with &#8216;the hand&#8217; (ctrl key) and move it to a different room so Frank will not see you take it.<br />
7. Tamper with the AC control near the Garage Door<br />
8. Talk to Stephanie<br />
-Ask if she&#8217;s having fun<br />
9. Give Whipped Cream to Stephanie<br />

12. Talk to Stephanie<br />

That&#8217;s as far as Stephanie&#8217;s Story goes at the moment.</p>
<p>Now you can go upstairs, talk to Britney a couple of times and eventually tell her you got Stephanie topless downstairs and she will go down to check it out because she&#8217;s a s u p e r d y k e. That&#8217;s as far as Britney&#8217;s Story goes at the moment.</p>
