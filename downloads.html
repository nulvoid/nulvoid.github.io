<P>Just as a note, some downloads are from this site and some link to Mediafire. That is because of a 25 MB file size limit. Only these two sites will be used for downloads, any other site is not from me.</P>

<A HREF = "http://www.mediafire.com/file/l24j3g84hd1lwf5/slmseries.zip">Super late model series</A>
<P>This super late model series comes with two super late model rosters, one that came with the original download and one I created using cars downloaded from http://www.racingrafix.com/forum/index.php?action=media;sa=album;in=3 and combined and edited. I named that roster the All Star Series. Works best with the late model EXE available below. When installing make a folder in the series folder for this one, will update that eventually.</P>
<A HREF = "/downloads/lmpv2.zip">Late Model Project V2</A>
<P>Original LMPV2, ready to be installed. No other modifications included with this download.</P>

<A HREF = "http://www.mediafire.com/file/5z4fnfoki41455p/NR2003.rar">NR2003</A>
<P>Comes with everything you need to start playing, including crack and 1.2.0.1 update.</P>
<A HREF = "/downloads/nr2003latemodelexe.zip">Late Model EXE</A>
<P>This late model EXE is specifically built for racing late models in NR2003. PTA cars have a rev limiter set to 8000, GNS cars have a rev limiter set to 7000, and CTS cars have a rev limiter set to 9000. I personally haven't testing any other cars, but weights are realistic for late model (GNS) and super late model (PTA) racing.</P>
<A HREF = "/downloads/modifycarfiles.zip">Car file converter</A>
<P>Use this to convert car files to another format, EX GNS to PTA.</P>
